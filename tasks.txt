This application serves 3 URL's:

/bookstore/books - list all books
/bookstore/authors - lists all authors
/bookstore/books-by-author/<author> - list all books written or co-written by a specific author

Task 1
------

It uses a file repository, but unfortunately it is not entirely stable. A call to get the books
mostly succeeds, but can occasionally result in a read error, it can run out of memory, or it can
be in an illegal state.

These errors needs to be handled, in the following way:
- for a read error, 2 retry attempts should be made. If both retries fails, it should return
  the http code 404 (not found).
- for out-of-memory, it should not retry but just return http 503, and the http header
  "Retry-After" with a value of 10.
- for illegal state, the server should stop handling requests normally, but instead
  return 500 (internal server error) for all future calls.

All of this should be logged.
