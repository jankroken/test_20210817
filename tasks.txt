1. implement FileBookRepository, and write a unit test to verify that it can load the books from
   book_list.txt

2. Implement the methods in BookController. The calls should return json (which is the default)

3. Imagine that the file actually have millions of books. Change the implementation of FileBookRepository
   so that it caches the result. Also change the application so that it's fast to look up authors or
   to look up books by author.

4. imagine the book_list.txt data are in an SQL database table instead of book_list.txt. Open a
   text file and write down the create statements for tables to represent the data. Then write
   down the 3 SQL's that would perform the same functionality as the 3 rest methods (so one
   SQL query to list all books, one to list all unique authors, and one to select all the books
   by one author)
